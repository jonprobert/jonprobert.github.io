A useful rule-of-thumb to estimate the frictional losses in a system for a different pipe diameter is to multiply your calculated frictional losses for a known diameter by the ratio of diameters to the fifth power.

Darcy-Weisbach tells Us:

$$\Delta P=\frac{\rho fLv^2}{2D}$$

At constant volumetric flow velocity changes with pipe area, so substitute $v=\frac{Q}{A}=\frac{4Q}{\pi D^2}$

$$\Delta P=\frac{8\rho fLQ^2}{\pi^2D^5}$$

Assuming density, Darcy friction factor, volumetric flowrate, and pipe length are constant we can simplify to:

$$\Delta P\propto\frac{1}{D^5}$$

Applying this to states 1 and 2 with differing pipe diameter and constants as described above:

$$\Delta P_{2}=\Delta P_{1}\left ( \frac{D_{1}}{D_{2}} \right )^5$$
