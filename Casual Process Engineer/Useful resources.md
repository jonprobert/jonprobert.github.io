## Webplot digitiser

Have you ever needed to input a pump curve into excel and you've only got a PDF? Or worse still, a microfilm scan or photocopy of the curve from 1962?

Good news! No longer do you have to input all the points manually, Web plot digitiser is here! Simply load your curve as an image, align the axes, click down the curve (there's also a automatic dection tool), and export as a .CSV.
